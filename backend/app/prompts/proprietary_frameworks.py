# Framework 1: Direct Care Feedback™
DIRECT_CARE_FEEDBACK = """
**Direct Care Feedback™ Framework**

Core principle: Balance empathy with clarity in feedback conversations.

**The Feedback Matrix:**
1. **Direct Care™** (high empathy + high clarity) ✅
   - Provide specific, actionable feedback
   - Show genuine investment in the person's growth
   - Example: "I observed [specific behavior]. Here's the impact and how to improve."

2. **Avoidance** (high empathy, low clarity) ❌
   - Being "nice" but not helpful
   - Withholding critical feedback to avoid discomfort

3. **Harshness** (low empathy, high clarity) ❌
   - Being brutally honest without consideration
   - Feedback feels like an attack, damages relationships

4. **Dishonesty** (low empathy, low clarity) ❌
   - Passive-aggressive or insincere feedback
   - Neither helpful nor genuine

**When to use:**
- Performance feedback conversations
- Addressing team dynamics
- Building trust through honest communication
- Navigating difficult conversations

**Key phrases:**
- "I'm sharing this because I care about your growth..."
- "Can I give you some direct feedback on [specific behavior]?"
- "What I observed was... and here's why it matters..."
- "Here's what I'd recommend you try..."

**Application in coaching:**
- Encourage leaders to practice direct, caring feedback
- Model it in coaching relationship (care + clarity)
- Help identify when they're avoiding tough conversations
- Practice specific feedback language

---

**Enhanced Concepts:**

**Conversation Safety (inspired by dialogue research):**
- Create psychological safety before difficult conversations
- Establish shared purpose ("We both want what's best for the team")
- When safety breaks down, pause and rebuild before continuing

**Fact vs Story Separation:**
- Facts: Observable behaviors ("You arrived 10 minutes late")
- Stories: Your interpretations ("You don't respect the team's time")
- Share your story as a story: "The story I'm telling myself is..."
- Opens dialogue for clarification

**Feedback Reception Skills:**
- Understand the three feedback types: Evaluation, Coaching, Appreciation
- Identify triggers: Truth (is it accurate?), Relationship (who's giving it?), Identity (what does it say about me?)
- Extract value even from imperfect feedback
- Set boundaries - you don't have to accept all feedback

# Framework 2: Leadership Foundation™
LEADERSHIP_FOUNDATION = """
**Leadership Foundation™ Framework**

Core focus: Building strong leadership capabilities from the ground up.

**The Leadership Triangle:**

1. **Purpose** - Ensure team knows WHY their work matters
   - Connect daily work to strategic goals
   - Clarify impact on customers and stakeholders
   - Create meaning beyond tasks

2. **People** - Build a team that works well together
   - Hire for strengths and cultural fit
   - Develop individual capabilities
   - Foster psychological safety
   - Address conflicts early

3. **Process** - Create efficient ways of working
   - Establish clear workflows
   - Remove unnecessary friction
   - Enable autonomy with accountability
   - Measure what matters

**Effective Feedback Structure:**
- Set clear expectations upfront
- Share specific observations (not judgments)
- Clarify impact on goals/team
- Discuss next steps collaboratively
- Follow up on progress

**1-on-1 Meeting Framework:**
- What's top-of-mind for them? (not your agenda)
- What blockers can you help remove?
- Team dynamics and collaboration
- Career development & growth
- Feedback both ways

**Delegation Ladder:**
```
Level 1: "Tell me what to do" → Micromanaging (needs development)
Level 2: "Here are the options" → Teaching mode (building skills)
Level 3: "Here's my plan" → Delegating with oversight (growing trust)
Level 4: "Here's what I did" → Full autonomy (mature delegation)
```

**When to use:**
- New leader transitions
- Building high-performing teams
- Delegation challenges
- Setting up team processes
- Performance management

**Key questions:**
- "What would make this team 2x more effective?"
- "Are you clear on why this work matters?"
- "What's blocking you that I can help remove?"
- "What decision-making authority do you need?"
- "Where on the delegation ladder is each team member?"

**Application in coaching:**
- Guide leaders through transitions
- Diagnose delegation maturity levels
- Structure effective 1-on-1s
- Build team purpose and process clarity

---

**Enhanced Concepts:**

**Coaching-Based 1-on-1 Structure (inspired by coaching research):**
- 2 min: Let them set the agenda ("What's most important to discuss?")
- 5 min: Deep dive with powerful questions:
  - "What's the real challenge here?"
  - "What have you tried? What else could you try?"
  - "What do you need from me?"
- 3 min: Clarify next actions and support

**Motivation Design (intrinsic motivation principles):**
- **Autonomy**: Give control over how work gets done
- **Mastery**: Create growth opportunities (challenges, learning)
- **Purpose**: Connect work to meaning and impact
- Key: Creative work needs intrinsic motivation more than external rewards

**Purpose-Driven Leadership:**
- Start with WHY: Why does this work matter? What do we believe?
- Then HOW: Our unique approach and values
- Then WHAT: The actual work and outcomes
- Communicate from inside-out: Purpose → Method → Results

# Framework 3: Power Ownership Model™
POWER_OWNERSHIP_MODEL = """
**Power Ownership Model™ Framework**

Core focus: Taking control of your career through ownership, influence, and evidence-based confidence.

**5 Career Limiting Beliefs (and how to overcome them):**

1. **"I'm not ready yet"** → Nobody is ever "fully ready"
   - Reality: Most people grow into roles, not before them
   - Action: List evidence of your preparation
   - Reframe: "I'm ready to learn and grow into this"

2. **"I don't deserve it"** → You've earned your seat
   - Reality: Others with similar or less experience have these roles
   - Action: Document your wins quarterly (brag file)
   - Reframe: "I've worked hard and delivered results"

3. **"It's never enough"** → Perfectionism is a trap
   - Reality: Progress > perfection, impact > hours
   - Action: Celebrate incremental progress
   - Reframe: "Good progress is good enough"

4. **"I can't have it all"** → Define YOUR "all"
   - Reality: You can have what you prioritize
   - Action: Clarify your top 3 priorities (others can wait)
   - Reframe: "I'm choosing what matters most to me"

5. **"It's too late"** → Career isn't linear
   - Reality: Many leaders pivot in their 40s, 50s, 60s
   - Action: Research late bloomers in your field
   - Reframe: "I'm bringing unique experience to this"

**Power = Ownership + Influence:**

**Own Your Narrative:**

- Build your professional brand
- Speak at meetings and events

**Own Your Career:**
- Don't wait for permission

- Seek stretch assignments
- Build strategic relationships

**Own Your Voice:**
- Speak up, even when uncomfortable
- Share ideas in high-stakes meetings
- Give direct feedback to peers and leaders
- Advocate for yourself and others

**Own Your Mistakes:**
- Failure is data, not identity
- Share lessons learned openly
- Take accountability quickly
- Move forward with new knowledge

**Visibility Strategy:**
1. Document your wins (keep a running list)
2. Share successes with stakeholders (don't assume they know)
3. Build strategic relationships (not just random networking)
4. Speak at meetings (even when nervous)
5. Volunteer for visible projects

**Negotiation Framework:**
- Know your market value (research > feelings)
- Ask for more than you think you deserve (room to negotiate)
- Negotiate beyond salary (equity, title, scope, flexibility)
- Practice saying "This is what I need" (confidence comes from preparation)
- Get it in writing

**When to use:**
- Career transitions & promotions
- Salary/promotion negotiations
- Overcoming self-doubt
- Building executive presence
- Navigating challenging environments

**Key questions:**
- "What evidence do you have for that belief?"
- "If your best friend told you this, what would you say?"
- "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
- "How are you claiming ownership of this situation?"
- "What wins from the past year prove you're ready?"

**Application in coaching:**
- Challenge limiting beliefs with evidence
- Build confidence through action (not just mindset)
- Create visibility & influence strategies
- Negotiate career moves strategically
- Document and celebrate progress

---

**Enhanced Concepts:**

**Inner Dialogue Management (inspired by performance psychology):**
- Identify your Inner Critic: That voice saying "you can't do this"
- Recognize Natural Ability: Skills you have without conscious effort
- Reduce interference through non-judgmental awareness
- Focus on the present moment, not outcomes
- Trust your capabilities developed through practice

**Growth Mindset Development:**

- Growth mindset: "I haven't mastered this yet" (abilities develop)
- Embrace challenges as growth opportunities
- View effort as the path to mastery
- Learn from criticism rather than deflecting
- "Not yet" is more powerful than "I can't"

**Intrinsic Motivation Activation:**
- Tap into what naturally energizes you

- Focus on the journey of improvement, not just outcomes
- Build resilience through meaningful goals

# Framework 5: Executive Evolution™
EXECUTIVE_EVOLUTION = """
**Executive Evolution™ Framework**

Core focus: Identifying and changing behaviors that limit senior leaders' effectiveness.

**20 Executive Derailers to Avoid:**

**Communication Derailers:**
1. **Winning too much** - Need to win every argument, even trivial ones
2. **Adding too much value** - Can't resist "improving" every idea shared
3. **Passing judgment** - Rating others constantly, unsolicited opinions
4. **Making destructive comments** - Sarcasm, cutting remarks, "just kidding"
5. **Starting with "No," "But," or "However"** - Immediately negating others
6. **Telling the world how smart we are** - Showing off, name-dropping
7. **Speaking when angry** - Losing emotional control, damaging relationships

**Relationship Derailers:**
8. **Withholding information** - Hoarding knowledge as power
9. **Failing to give recognition** - Not praising success, taking credit
10. **Claiming credit we don't deserve** - Taking others' contributions
11. **Making excuses** - Blaming circumstances or others
12. **Clinging to the past** - "We've always done it this way"
13. **Playing favorites** - Inconsistent treatment of team members
14. **Refusing to express regret** - Never apologizing or admitting mistakes

**Execution Derailers:**
15. **Not listening** - Interrupting, planning response while others speak
16. **Failing to express gratitude** - Not saying "thank you" enough
17. **Punishing the messenger** - Shooting the bearer of bad news
18. **Passing the buck** - Blaming others for your decisions
19. **An excessive need to be "me"** - "That's just who I am" (refusing to adapt)
20. **Goal obsession** - So focused on outcomes that you damage relationships

**The FeedForward Process:**
1. Pick **one behavior** to improve (not personality, just behavior)
2. Ask people: "What suggestions do you have for me in the future?"
3. **Listen only** - Don't defend, explain, or argue
4. Say "Thank you" (that's it, no commentary)
5. Repeat with 10-20 people for diverse perspectives
6. Follow up quarterly to track progress

**Apology Framework:**
- "I'm sorry, I was wrong" (specific and direct)
- Be specific about the behavior (not general)
- No "but" or justifications (undermines apology)
- Ask what you can do differently (shows commitment)
- Change the behavior (actions > words)

**When to use:**
- Senior executive coaching
- 360 feedback follow-up
- Reputation repair
- Leadership transition to C-suite
- Dealing with blindspots
- Preparing for board presentations
- High-stakes stakeholder management

**Key questions:**
- "What's one habit that's no longer serving you at this level?"
- "What would people say you need to stop doing?"
- "How are you getting in your own way?"
- "What would change if you stopped [specific behavior]?"
- "If you asked your team for one behavior change, what would they say?"
- "What worked at your previous level but not anymore?"

**Application in coaching:**
- Identify success patterns that became derailers at new level
- Systematic behavior change (not personality change)
- Stakeholder engagement for feedback (FeedForward)
- Track progress with specific behaviors (measurable)
- Focus on one behavior at a time (don't overwhelm)

---

**Enhanced Concepts:**

**Executive Coaching Principles (inspired by leadership coaching research):**
- **People First**: Address team dynamics before business strategy
- **Build Trust**: Listen deeply, understand context before advising
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Help executives see blind spots
- **Maintain Independence**: Provide objective perspective, don't take sides
- **Focus on Team Dynamics**: Individual issues often reflect team patterns

**Team Dynamics Observation:**
- Watch for communication patterns in team meetings
- Identify who speaks, who listens, who's excluded
- Notice decision-making dynamics (who influences, who decides)
- Address unhealthy conflict patterns early
- Help teams develop shared language and norms

**Blind Spot Identification:**
- Use 360 feedback to surface unseen behaviors
- Look for patterns: What behaviors helped you succeed before but limit you now?
- Common executive blind spots:
  - Over-reliance on strengths (what got you here won't get you there)
  - Difficulty receiving critical feedback
  - Assuming others see situations as you do
  - Underestimating your impact on others
- Create systematic feedback loops (quarterly check-ins with stakeholders)
